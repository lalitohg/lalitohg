## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lalitohg

This is my personal Github account for experiments, proofs of concept and any other kind of idea I might come up with.

Usually I devote myself to software development but having a repository is so cool that many other things might appear around here.

Take a look and have fun, I also have a blog on software development (in spanish) in case you are interested ðŸ‘‰ [www.dalerun.com](https://www.dalerun.com)
